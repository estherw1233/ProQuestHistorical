Negro Chrislmns spirituals are rare, but this year Mr. Kemper Harreld. director of the chorus, has found and arranged three new ones for the chorus ami glee club. One of these used to be sung by the Negro fishermen orf Charleston. South Carolina. Another, entitled Mighty Day, arranged by Dr. John W. Work and dedicated to Mr. Harrcld, will be sung by the Morehouse College Glee club. The third is one sung by the Negroes on St. Helena Island. South Carolina. The program also includes Mary's Baby, another spiritual which originated on St. Helena Island and was one of the favorites on last years list. The public is cordially invited to attend this concert. There is no charge for admission. P1 KILLED IN TRAIN CRASH West Palm Beach. Fla..

That the south will feel keenly the loss of the great Jewish philanthropist, more than any other  of the nation, was the sentiment expressed by J. M.

The Butler street branch is only one of 25 Negro branches, which were made possible by personal contributions from the noted chairman of the Sears. Roebuck company. Among other  to which Mr. Roscnwald has given various sums totaling more than .000 statistics in Mr. Chiles office show- j cd. were buildings at Chicago. Indianapolis, St. Louis. Columbus.

Though definite figures as to the sums donated toward local schools was not available Thursday data at the office of the Commission on Interracial Co-operation in the Standard building here showed thai Mr. Rosenwald had made substantial donations to Spelman and Morehouse college and to Morris Brown and Atlanta universities. Additional information gained at the Commission's headquarters showed that through money donated by the Rosenwald Fund,  more than 5500 schools for Negroes had been erected throughout the south in rural districts unable to finance educational means for (Continued on Page 2)                 JULIUS ROSENWALD                 c A.S.P.

It  Mr. Kosenwald's idea that this 'would keep the citizens interested ;in the maintenance of the project. I Born in Springfield, Illinois. 1 August 12. 1802. Mr. Rosenwnlil founded his fortune in the clothing business. He was a clothier s clerk in Springfield at 15. owner of a Fifth avenue shop in New York City at 21. arid a manufacturer in Chicago at 23. It was in 1895\" that he purchased for 570.000 a halt-interest in the company through whose success he realized his greatest desire, to battle against racial and religious intolerance, and to educate and rehabilitate the poor of many . The report of the work of the Julius Rosenwald Fund for the past years shows that the work begun by Mr. Rosenwald in 1913 in erecting schoolhouses for Negroes and which has been continued by the Fund, has resulted in the building of 5.295 structures. These buildings, I the report reads, arc integral parts of the public school systems of the stales concerned and are maintained entirely from tax funds. These buildings now stand in 877 counties of fifteen southern states: there remaining only about 100 counties with ten per cent of Neqro population which have not one or more of these modern schools.","Abstract":"Julius Rosenwald's sudden and untimely death in Chicago Wednesday has revived in the minds of grateful Atlantans his many contributions both personal and through his Fund and Foundation towards local schools, and community organizations and projects.","_deepnote_index_column":58},{"RecordID":490383804,"AlphaPubDate":"Mar 29, 1932","Publisher":"Atlanta Daily World","FullText":"                                           There is no doubt about it, bad appetites do breed bad dispositions, which, in their turn, induce bad appetites, and so on, around the endless circle, until prheaps the home may be broken or irreparable hurts received and given.","Abstract":"1005880true1007945true1008888true1009131true10000046true10000227true10000277true","_deepnote_index_column":59},{"RecordID":490383819,"AlphaPubDate":"Mar 20, 1932","Publisher":"Atlanta Daily World","FullText":"                                           Bleach Your Skin To New Beauty No woman can win tho complete admiration of men unless her skin Is light, clear and sort.

ADAMS                 A former Post Office clerk, charged with killing his wife and injuring her employer in a West Hunter shooting last May was sentenced to life imprisonment Tuesday after he entered a plea of guilty to murder charges.                 John Dennard, 33, of 100 MaysonTurner Ave., was sentenced, by Superior Court Judge E. E. Andrews to imprisonment \"for his natural life\" in the fatal shooting of his wife. He also was sentenced to serve from five to 10 years for shooting James W. Couch, and, in addition, must serve 12-months for a pistol- misdemeanor, the terms to run concurrently. CHOKING CASE Meanwhile, in the second division of Superior Court, two men charged with choking and cutting to death a young woman were found guilty and sentenced each to serve not less than 15 years nor more than 20 in prison. The convicted men, Ike Hayes, Jr. and LeRoy Freeman were accused of slaying Mrs. Pannie Lou Amy on June 17 \"by cutting, stabbing and wounding her with a knife and by choking her with a leather belt and a pocket handkerchief.\" They were arraigned before Judge Jesse Wood. DENNARD S MURDER PLEA NEW Dennard's plea, admitting guilt to murder, was facilitated by a new law passed during the last session of the state legislature. The new law permits a Judge to hear a guilty to murder plea without making it mandatory to sentence the defendant to death by electrocution. (Continued on Page 8 Column 4)                 Affanfan Given T (CoiiiiuusU Fium rage One) Dennurd, accompanied by Uirec of his brothers, surrendered to police May 30 after a 15-hour manhunt.

The woman was working unsuspectingly at Deluxe Cleaners on W. Hunter St. when six bullets were pumped into her head and chest. A seventh bullet injured Couch, the woman s employer. However, all of the shots apparently were intended for Mrs. Dennard. The couple had been separated two weeks, It was reported. OTHER CASES In other court action: James W. Morris was sentenced to one year for burglarizing the home of Willie J. Smith, 255 Rawson St. on May 22; William Lawrence was given from two to four years for assault with intent to rob R. H. Tyson, 669 Kelly St., SE, on July 31; and JameS Lee Jones was judged \"not g-\" on one count and guilty on another count of burglary. He was sentenced to one to two years, with the recommendation that his punishment be treated as a misdemeanor.

The incident which was  from Henderson, Texas, Monday night, resulted in international repercussions since the British Embassy and the U. S. Department have expressed an interest. The Justice Department expressed its intentions immediately after it learned that Essin Kssin, a theological student at Southwest College in Terrell, Texas, had suffered abuse at the hands of the Henderson policemen. VICTIM OF OLD \"BACK SEAT\" ORDER The 30-year-old student, was said to have been seated midway a Continental Trailway bus enroute from Terrell to Houston, Texas. When he refused to take a back seat at the request of the driver a policeman was notified. The patrolman. L. L. Boatwright, is said to have grabbed the African by the arm and escorted him to the back of the vehicle. When he refused to sit down he was hit with a \"slap-jack\"' by the policeman. Boatwright claimed that he tapped the Negro when he reached into his coat pocket. Essin said he was reaching for his passport to show the officer. The policeman claimed that Essin sat down but when he returned to the bus a shor ttime later the student had taken a seat in the center of the bus again. He then arrested the young minister and carried him to the city hall. There he was fined $25 by the City Judge Barto Giles. He was placed in jail because he had only S24 with him. He was later released when an official of the college which he is attending paid his fine.","Abstract":"                                           WASHINGTON -- (ANP)--The United States Department of Justice announced this week that it has under consideration the investigation of the alleged beating and jailing of an African student who refused to take the back seat on a Texas bus.","_deepnote_index_column":24969},{"RecordID":491128415,"AlphaPubDate":"Oct 18, 1957","Publisher":"Atlanta Daily World","FullText":"                                           E9    1      TRANSMISSION SERVICE Any Make- Any Model 3-HOUR SERVICE I E-Z TERMS DIAL TR. 5-5931 887 Marietta St., NW","Abstract":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":24970},{"RecordID":491133339,"AlphaPubDate":"Feb 16, 1958","Publisher":"Atlanta Daily World","FullText":"                                           RECONDITIONED 25 apartment t J T WESTINGHOUSE $ \"ZZ^- -V;~\\ REFRIGERATORS *f^\"N^- ALL GUARANTEE!*.?;.; I 8^^^^S,J B BUY I *$'*{] ^^3L I ONE 1:1;' ;:   ^^J now I j:  _^..v ^T:c I       chef __-~~fe==asas*-- 'I ^J TABLE TOP p f    -f 'f i jc :j6ASRAHaES ?;i .l':~;     ...j    HEAT- '^ttl^mmg^ s i\"^ control: \\   PILOT LIGHT 'i:f:p-M^ C j}_ PORCELAIN Iv'^S.SS  i! l_L $ oven '^SS7?*:J NICE BROILER H* gj jf t GUARANTEED ^rs^?~   *-^-wJL__^^ l* 8*","Abstract":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":24971},{"RecordID":491134204,"AlphaPubDate":"Jan 12, 1958","Publisher":"Atlanta Daily World","FullText":"                                           PHILADELPHIA-- (INS) -- The National Collegiate Athletic Association wound up its 53nd Annual Convention Thursday with a flurry of final committee reports and balloting on numerous amendments.","Abstract":"1005880true1007945true1008888true1009131true10000046true10000227true10000277true","_deepnote_index_column":24972},{"RecordID":491136814,"AlphaPubDate":"Feb 13, 1958","Publisher":"Atlanta Daily World","FullText":"                                           why Ancient Age can say: i \"IF BOURBON ^Hk^ B^~ 0 IB unit All we distill is Kentucky straight bourbon.
